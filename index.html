<th><div style = "color: #990000 ; font-family: century gothic"><p>My name is Alexandra Tedder and I am a senior at the University of Georgia. I am a 
communication studies major and I will be graduating in May 2018. When I graduate, I would love to become a public relations specialist for 
a company in Atlanta. I am 23 years old and I am originally from Acworth, Georgia. One day, I would like to move to another state because I have 
lived in Georgia my entire life. I would love to live in Colorado, Arizona, Texas, or Tennessee. My biggest strengths are:</p>
<OL>
<li>being extremely organized</li> 
<li>ability to work well under pressure</li> 
<li>excellent verbal and writing skills</li>
<li>ability to learn new things quickly</li>
</OL>
My weakness is often over-thinking things. My talents include singing and dancing. I have been singing for just a couple of years and I have been 
dancing 
since I was three years old. Dance is definitely my biggest passion in life.</div>

<UL>
<li>“Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. 
We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, 
but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly 
do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.”–Aristotle</li>
<li>“If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. 
Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing 
attitude.”–Charles R. Swindoll</li>
<li>“Desire is the key to motivation, but it’s determination and commitment to an unrelenting 
pursuit of your goal — a commitment to excellence — 
that will enable you to attain the success you seek.”–Mario Andretti</li>
<li>“All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront 
unequivocally the major anxiety of their 
people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of 
leadership.”–John Kenneth Galbraith</li>

</td><td><p style = "color: white ; font-family: lucida calligraphy"> At my university, 
I am part of the athletic dance team. We are called the Dance Dawgs and we perform at every men’s and women’s basketball game as well as gymnastics 
meets, soccer games and volleyball games. Another aspect of being on the team includes community service. Throughout the season, we make appearances 
at various community events such as Relay for Life, the Boys and Girls Club of Athens, various homeless shelters, Habitat for Humanity, and the 
Georgia Nutrition Association. Being a part of the team is very rewarding and has taught me many valuable lessons that I can carry on in life. 
It has taught me responsibility, what it means to be committed to something, how to be on time, the true meaning of hard work, and all about 
dedication. To find out about other events we are doing and keep up with the team, you can visit the
